Finch
=====

Finch is a format for specifying interconnections and component
hierarchies. This project aims to provide a language for making
input/output connections between components and defining hierarchic
component structures, along with a set of utilities to generate code
and documentation from these definitions. Component input/output
interfaces are defined using `Smidgen`_.

`Finch`_ is part of the `Code Craftsmen`_ project.  The
`documentation`_ is hosted on `Read the Docs`_ and the `source code`_
can be found on `GitHub`_.
